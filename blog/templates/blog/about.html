<h1>About this project</h1>
<p>
  This is a django app. It will be soon converted into a
  <span class="text-primary">Job Portal platform like LinkedIn</span>. I have
  worked on Job Model as well. I have started implementing frontend in React
  because I need an asynchronous way to handle requests and make frontend
  easier.
